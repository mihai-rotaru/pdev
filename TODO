IGNORE:
- if an ignore file is not specified by using the -i flag, then archives
listed in the IGNORE file will be ignored ( not extracted )
- if an ignore file is specified, the IGNORE file will be ignored
( that is, the setup script will only look in the file supplied as a
command line argument for archives to ignore )
Ex:
    setup.bat -i no_dev.txt ~> will ignore files listed in no_dev.txt,
                               and the all other archives will be unpacked
                               ( even if listed in the IGNORE file )

PRIORITY
- if a file named PRIORITY exists in pdev root, files from it will be unpacked
first ( in the order specified in the file )
