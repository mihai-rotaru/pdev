pdev - portable development

1. Why ?
If you study computer science at school/uni, you probably want to customise the
development environment. It is also very likely the machines at your uni have
their BIOSs locked and don't allow booting from CD/USB. pdev is designed to make
it as easy as possible to automate the injection of a MinGW ecosystem on a host
for C/C++/Java programming.

2. How ?
The core of pdev is setup.bat. When you run this file, it will iterate over 7z archives
in the current folder, and unzip each in a folder specified by you ( by default - C:\pdev ).

hooks
Unzipping MinGW is not sufficient to make it work - you need to setup environment variables.
For this, you can use hooks. There are two kinds of hooks: pre and post. Hooks are .bat files
placed in the 'hooks' foler. For each package, setup.bat looks in this folder for hooks to
execute. If you place a file named 'pre-MinGW.bat' in the 'hooks' directory, setup.bat will
execute it before the unzipping process. If you have a file named 'post-MinGW.bat', it will
be executed after the unzipping process.

You can add hooks for any package. To disable a hook, you can delete/move it to another folder,
or you can rename it. If a file in the 'hooks' folder does not have a name of the form
pre-package.bat or post-package.bat, it is ignored.
