|  When installing from USB to host:   |
o--------------------------------------o

The INSTALL.BAT file will create the TARGET_DIR on the host.
Then, for each 7z archive in the bat's root folder, it
will extract it to the destination. ?: a ignore file

It will also create the PUSH.BAT in the target dir, and
in it set a variable which points back to the folder from
which the setup was launced. This will enable PUSH.BAT to
update the archives with the new versions of any modified files,
and to add newly created files. Files that were deleted from
disk will also be removed from the archives. ?: if a switch is spec.

o---------------------------------o
|  When updating archives on USB  |
o---------------------------------o

When pdev was installed on the host, the PUSH.BAT file created
a list of folders created during the installation ( FOLDERS ).
This was done so that the user will have the ability to create new
folders inside the TARGET_DIR which will be ignored by PUSH.BAT when
updating the archives in the ORIGIN_DIR. 

For each newly created folder, ( one which is not found in the FOLDERS
file ), the user will be asked whether he desires to include it in the
archives. If yes, a new archive will be created in ORIGIN_DIR, named as
the folder with the 7z extension.

o---------------------------------o
|  Running apps from the USB      |
o---------------------------------o

Applications run directly from the USB might run a lot slower,
so the recommended way is to copy them to the host and then run.


o---------------------------------o
|  Hooks                          |
o---------------------------------o

Hooks - .bat files which can be executed before or/and after the installation
( unzipping ) of a package ( a 7z archive ). For example, for MinGW, a hook
would set up the environment variables neccesary for compiling.

o---------------------------------o
|  'Get' mode                     |
o---------------------------------o

Using wget, the installer is downloaded; then a corresponding ahk ( autohotkey )
script is run which will automatically install the package.
